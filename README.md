# Practice with Playwright

Practice using the Playwright testing library

1. Create a basic [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/library) test that goes to [netflix.com](https://www.netflix.com) and verifies that you cannot sign in with an invalid email/password combination. Add your code to the `index.js` file after the `// YOUR CODE STARTS` comment. The command `npm run test` will run your test.

2. Optional: If you want to add an assertion, you can use Playwright (example: [page.waitForSelector](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-wait-for-selector) or [page.waitForFunction](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-wait-for-function)).
